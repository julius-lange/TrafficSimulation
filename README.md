# TrafficSimulation
A very rough simulation of road congestion and suggested solutions using networkx and osmnx for university entrepreneurship project. Very badly commented unfortunately.

The important parts are the traffic simulation 1 and 2 files which define the functions used in the simulations. These are primarily some graph generations functions like importing and initialising them using osmnx and several (different) routing algorithms which try to find the system optimal routing for all participants with mixed success and very long runtimes. Test 3 puts these to test with a street network taken from central London.

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact me. The document is the pitch presentation about this idea.
